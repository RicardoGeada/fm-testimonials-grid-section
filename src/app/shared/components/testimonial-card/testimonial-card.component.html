    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
    if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s
    worth.

    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
    experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
    incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
    best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
    I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
    startup. ”
